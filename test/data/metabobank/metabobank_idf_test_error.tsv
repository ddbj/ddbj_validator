Protocol Description	"Cell culture and transfection: HEK293T, PC3, LNCap and HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (high glucose, Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) at 37°C (5% CO2, humidified atmosphere). HEK293T cells (3 x 106) seeded in 100 mm dishes were transfected in 8 mL Opti-MEM (Gibco) using 10 µg plasmid DNA and 30 µL PEI Max (Polysciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 hr of transfection, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS.
Cell and tissue sample preparation: Cells were harvested using a cell scraper&nbsp;and collected into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH7.4) transferred to a glass tube, and centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 5 min to pellet cells. Cells (3 x 106) were resuspended in 1.5 mL methanol and subjected to lipid extraction (see below). For mouse prostate tissues, 20 mg tissue was transferred to a Lysing Matrix D tube (MP Bio) in 200 µL methanol. Tissue was homogenized using a FastPrep-24TM 5G (MP Bio), transferred to a glass tube containing 1.5 mL methanol, and subjected to lipid extraction.
Preparation of conditioned medium: Cells were grown to 60-70% confluence, whereupon the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium (DMEM, 0.1% BSA, 10 mM HEPES, pH7.4). After 20 hr incubation, culture supernatants were collected in 15 mL tubes, centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 5 min, and filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose acetate discs (DISMIC) to remove debris. The filtrate (conditioned medium; CM) was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. For analysis of extracellular phosphoinositides, filtrate (100 µL) was carefully thawed, mixed with 1.5 mL methanol, and subjected to lipid extraction.
Preparation of mouse plasma: Plasma was prepared from の the blood of anaesthetized mice according to a standard protocol3. Briefly, C57BL/6J mice were fasted for 6 hr followed by intraperitoneal injection of PBS (control) or 50 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Blood was collected at 2 hr post-injection and plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 10 min. Plasma (100 µL) was mixed with 1.5 mL methanol and subjected to lipid extraction.
Preparation of exosomes: Cells (5 x 106) were seeded in 150-mm culture dishes and cultured for 24 hr. After two washes of the dishes with PBS, RPMI containing 1% exosome-depleted FBS was added. After 48 hr incubation, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C and then passed through a 0.22 µm filter (Millipore., Bedford, MA, USA) to remove cells and cellular debris. Filtered supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 110,000 x g for 70 min at 4°C (SW41Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter), and the pellets were washed with trehalose-containing HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 25 mM trehalose) to prevent the aggregation of exosomes. Resuspended pellets were re-ultracentrifuged at 110,000 x g for 70 min at 4°C, and finally resuspended in HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.4). The size distribution and concentration of exosomes were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) performed using a NanoSight LM10 instrument (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). Exosomes (1x1010 particles) were mixed with 1.5 mL methanol and subjected to lipid extraction.
Chemical standard: For acquisition of linear correlations between the ion-current peak areas and chemical amounts ranging from sub-fmol to 50 pmol of the phosphoinositide standards (Fig.1d, e and Table S1)."
