In summary, we combined the dimer eliminators from (Kawano et al. 2010, BioTechniques, 49(4), pp.751???755), with template-switching (Ko &amp; Y.

In brief, adenylated 3\' adapters adenylated in 5\' and blocked in 3\' (5\'-AppATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG-idT-3\') were ligated to 3\' ends of 3\'-OH small RNAs using a truncated T4 RNA ligase 2 enzyme (NEB). cDNA was primed using a oligonucleotide complementary to the 3\' adaptor in the presence of dimer eliminator and template-switching oligonucleotides ending with three random ribonucleotides 5\'-TAGTCGAACTGAAGGTCTCCAXXXrNrNrN-3 where is XXX is barcode\'. The cDNAs were amplified using 12???15 PCR cycles using a forward primer targeting the 5\' adaptor and extending it with additional sequence for bridge PCR, and a reverse primer targeting the 3\' adaptor (which is ready for bridge PCR). The amplified cDNA library was run on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel and the 100 bp to 300 bp range containing cDNAs up to 200 nt-long inserts cut in three fractions according to the insert size: 1-50 nt, 50-150 nt and 1-200 nt.

Four micrograms of total RNA was used for library construction using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer???s protocol. Briefly, poly-A containing mRNAs were purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. The purified mRNAs were fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperatures, and then converted to dsDNA by two rounds of cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase I. After an end repair process, DNA fragments were ligated with adaptor oligos. The ligated products were amplified using 15 cycles of PCR to generate RNA-seq library. Library integrity was verified by Bioanalyzer DNA1000 assay (Agilent technologies). Sequencing was performed in 39bp paired end mode using Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina).

The purified mRNAs were fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperatures, and then converted to dsDNA by two rounds of cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase I. After an end repair process, DNA fragments were ligated with adaptor oligos. The ligated products were amplified using 15 cycles of PCR to generate RNA-seq library. Library integrity was verified by Bioanalyzer DNA1000 assay (Agilent technologies). Sequencing was performed in 39bp paired end mode using Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina).

Here, we report a comparison miRNAexpression profiling in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) examined by NGS andmicroarray. Materials and methods:Total RNA (14 HCCs and 6 surrounded non-tumor tissues) was converted intocDNA libraries with adapter sequences.

Using 10 HCC templates, the correlation of miRNAsexpressions between NGS and microarray was examined. The averagecorrelation logarithmic index of miRNA expressions was 0.613.

The expression level of 3 miRNAs (miR-10b-5p,miR-143-3p, miR-21-5p) in non-tumor tissue was lower than that in HCC(p<0.05). The diagnostic accuracy, p-value, and AUC in HCC by using these11 miRNAs expression pattern are 90.0%, 7.224E-04, and 0.92 of AUC,respectively. Finally candidates of novel miRNAs were also detected by NGSanalysis.Conclusions:The reproducibly of the miRNA expression profile using NGS analysis wassatisfied and miRNA expression profile by using NGS was concordance with that by microarray. Moreover, the discovery of the novel miRNAs canbe easily applied by NGS.
